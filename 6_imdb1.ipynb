After Season 1, I couldn\\'t work out why the reviews were so good, I just wasn\\'t finding it that funny, and wasn\\'t keen on the characters, but I knew I had to keep watching. I think the mistake I made was expecting it to be as laugh out loud as something like Modern Family for example. With Catherine O\\'Hara and Eugene Levy who have made me laugh so much with things like Best In Show and a Mighty Wind I was expecting the same thing. But then it just clicked, subtle jokes, characters that become more and more lovable each episode, and really touching moments which have made me shed a tear on more than one occasion. By season five I was feeling sad that there was only going to be one more season after this. This is so well written, and the first time I\\'ve seen Dan Levy in anything, and he is just brilliant. If you\\'re thinking of switching off, don\\'t, keep going!'\n",
